# InSAR Reference Point Selection Method

This repository contains the Python scripts, Jupyter Notebooks, and MintPy configuration files developed as part of my PhD research at the University of Melbourne. The project focuses on improving the reliability of InSAR time-series analysis through advanced reference point selection techniques.

# Repository Structure
* **`Reference Point Selection Methods/`**: Notebook for the different selection methods.
* **`MintPy Results/`**: Small-baseline configuration (`.cfg`) files used for processing.
* **`Final Displacement Plot.ipynb`**: The primary notebook used to visualize displacement time-series
